The *DSGE.jl* package implements the FRBNY DSGE model and provides general code
to estimate many user-specified DSGE models. The package is introduced in the
Liberty Street Economics blog post
[The FRBNY DSGE Model Meets Julia](http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/12/the-frbny-dsge-model-meets-julia.html).

This Julia-language implementation mirrors the MATLAB code
included in the Liberty Street Economics blog post
[The FRBNY DSGE Model Forecast](http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/05/the-frbny-dsge-model-forecast-april-2015.html).

This branch of the FRBNY *DSGE.jl* package also implements Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling as an alternative to Metropolis Hastings 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. This additional code is based upon Edward Herbst and Frank Schorfheide's 2014 paper "Sequential Monte Carlo Sampling
for DSGE Models" and the code accompanying their book *Bayesian Estimation of DSGE Models*. Currently, FRBNY's implementation of SMC works on the 
small-scale New Keynesian DSGE model presented in Sungbae An and Frank Schorfheide's 2007 paper "Bayesian Analysis of DSGE Models". FRBNY is 
currently working on extending the code so that SMC may be used with medium-scale DSGE models. This and other extensions of the DSGE model code 
may be released in the future at the discretion of FRBNY.

## Usage

Once you've followed the installation instructions for the main `DSGE.jl` package, you can switch the the SMC branch by opening your terminal, navigating to the top level `DSGE.jl` directory, and running `git checkout smc`. To return to the original *DSGE.jl* package, run `git checkout master`. The file `test_smc.jl` in  `DSGE\docs\examples\` is the appropriate place for a new user to start. It initializes a new model, sets some SMC-related parameters, runs SMC, and generates a Latex document documenting parameter moments. 

Currently, SMC works only on the small-scale An Schorfheide model. On medium-scale models such as model 990, SMC frequently fails after the first stage, as the initial particles are usually all from regions of such low likelihood than none of them receive non-zero weights after the first stage. Current work on this branch is focused on addressing this issue, as well as implementing blocked parameter sampling and an adaptive tuning schedule (as discussed in "Sequential Monte Carlo Sampling for DSGE Models").
